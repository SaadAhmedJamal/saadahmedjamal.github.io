                              <b>1) Satellite Based Atmospheric Observations</b>
                              <p>Dr Shahnawaz, a researcher and professor, introduced his research. we were told about severe effects of Climate Change, how much it is changing, and where it is changing. Different Interesting Visualizations for global datasets were shown with its corresponding effect on the globe. Professor demonstrated the NASA and NOAA efforts towards its mitigation. 2018 was hottest year recorded since 1800s. The climate pattern is changing and Earth is being warmed. A number of floods were observed in Europe during July and August are reflections of climate change. Carbon dioxide concentration, despite being a very small quantity in atmosphere, a slight change in its concentration is causing a global warming.

                              <b>2) Geospatial applications of Satellite based Atmospheric and Climatic Observations, Case studies from India</b>
                              <p>With a background in Climate Change related research, I could better understand the case studies. For the global analysis, I was surprised to see that some parts of the world do not have zero concertation of aerosols. It was evident that increased aerosol concentration has something to do with anthropogenic activities. I could relate to the grey air presence due to aerosols because I have experienced it during winters. The state of art spatial resolution for aerosol concentration is similar to the other open climate data available online. I was aware of monsoon wind pattern but was not for the seasonal change in regional concentration of aerosol. Also evident from WHO report, lungs related diseases have become more common in the big cities in the region which seems to be directly related to the higher concentration of atmospheric pollutants. Distinctions in Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) due elevation zone and latitude differences could be observed through spatio-temporal maps. Interesting conclusions were drawn by relating AOT with COVID lockdown in April 2020. It was wisely addressed that using higher resolution might not be always the best solution as scale of analysis and understanding of problem matters to a great extent.

                              <b>3) Movement Analysis: Extracting information from trajectories</b>
                              <p>Spatial information if changes over time it was regarded as movement by Professor Josef Strobl. A line is dot that went for a walk. I came to know the exact definition of trajectory which time enabled vector polyline. A line is generally represented by points with x and y. For trajectory we need to have time dimension with each point occasionally supported by direction. I had read about the Tobler’s law and spatial auto correlation several times. Relational Geography tends to be based on the same principle. I feel lucky to be in a generation were location based analysis have become easier because in previous days it was a tedious task as explained in the lecture. Trajectory type for aero plane has three dimensions, ship has two dimensions while train has one dimension except time. Cartographic Visualizations (maps and animations) for trajectory maps were very different and appealing. Geofencing might not be oversubscribed by the scientists but it is very popular among the advertisement agencies nowadays. Many decisions of the real world are based upon our understanding through virtual representation of the world, this is a good technique for a broader description of geospatial information analytics or Geoinformatics world.

                              <b>4) Spatially Enabled Learning </b>
                              <p>This was one of the topics I was less familiar with but I found it very interesting. The use of GIS in improving education and cognitive skills. The researcher had students who are going to be future high school teachers. The main research question was how to improve high school education using GIS. Effectively, now Geomedia is being used to foster spatial and analytical thinking in classrooms. The dual coding theory, visual and verbal stimuli and human cognition system sounded interesting. Its been empirically proven that the visual information shows way higher memorability. From activating (learning) point of view both visual and verbal stimuli should be used and the researcher was trying to implement this thing in his slides. Cognitive Load theory was already known that our brain can only perform a limited tasks after which we cannot process anymore but split attention effect was new and interesting. Modern geomedia has potential to minimize split attention effect.

                              <b>5) Urban planning and participation</b>
                              <p>I was one of the two people in class who had attended a class on Urban planning. Therefore, the researcher Elena was more curious about our input. I had taken a course during my bachelors titled as Land Use Planning also I had worked on few assignments related to urban planning however, I do not think of myself as an expert for urban planning. The researcher discussed maps of big cities and traditional urban planning models which sounded familiar to me like Hoyt sector model. The Garden City plan by Ebenezer Howard, for which I did not know earlier, was regarded as one of the better city plan. Interestingly, it was proved that a city is not a tree as some parts of urban life are not connected to the others. Therefore, big cities despite being attractive due to diversity, might not be sustainable. On the other hand, the importance of public participation should be emphasized in Urban Planning.

                              <b>6) Social media data analysis</b>
                              <p>How the data actually looks like. Working with social media data and procedures
                              Some generally understood stuff about social media were told by the researcher in the introduction. Getting to know about global and region specific statistics was interesting. Increasing amount of user generated data through social media seems to create more scope in future for big data handling supported by spatial information. I second the authors opinion that a subset of social media cannot be used to consider general public opinion on an event.

                              <b>7) Graffiti as Spatial Information</b>
                              <p>Very interesting deductions and a different perspective for generating spatial information and relate it with the context to draw factual conclusions. A common issue Graffiti which is generally considered as negative, the presenter also show both sides of graffiti and then later told why it is common at some places. Football graffiti was studied by the researcher and he came up with very different results proving that even a positive thing can have strong negative effects and vice versa. I was totally unaware of different types of graffiti. It was good to know the use of GIS with different perspective, having such a view has a good potential to introduce new application domains. The cities within Poland was taken as case study, this study can be applied to other cities of the world as well. 
                              Astonishing to know that a simple task such as painting a wall on large scale could be so much expensive (500,000 Euro). 
                              Map based trends visualization was easy to understand.

                              <b>8) A matter of context: how map use situations shape the use and design of map</b>
                              <p>We have maps in our pockets in our mobiles. So therefore, map visualization assessment was made in order to make user centric design approach. Understanding cognitive limits for maps was new. Hearing about spatial cognition and spatiall accuracy that a person could recall memory by pointing out on map. Some general  facts were told like why user centric design approach is important.  I agree with the the presenter’s idea that regarded the context definition any information that characterizes the situation of a user as too broad and should now be category wise. Interesting to know about Archetype (combination of characteristics that best describe the dataset) and Archetypical analysis (detecting similarities and differences in dataset). Map design adaptation is a good technique for changing technologies. Research related to Trustworthy maps could prove to change GIS Industry.

                              <p>H Augustin PhD Researcher
                              Introduced Earth Observation Data Cube which reduces complexity by bringing users to the data instead of bringing data to the user and by managing data as multi-dimensional arrays. Sharing the main motivation behind Earth Observation Data Cube told to be Landsat in 2008 making its archive data as public. Now, with increasing data (petabytes), it is becoming more and more important to use data efficiently. Big data is great but there are some challenges, As throughout the world it is a general known fact that data is increasing at a faster rate as compared to computational resources. Also, it is useless to have redundant data at multiple computers. Semantic Data Cube allows data to be stored in a query optimized way instead acquisition optimized way which is more of a logical view on storing data.

                              <b>10) Simulating future settlement development: GIS-basis models & Web application. Alpine Buidling Center
                              Sabine Gadocha and Yingwen Deng</b>
                              <p>The research had focus on alpine buildings and simulating future simulation models as supported by GIS. The lecture included background and challenges
                              GIS models for settlement, Web application for simulating the scenarios. Austria has a high land usage. 7% of total settlement area. Annual landusage decreased since 2012. Which is contrary to what is happening in different parts of the world. High cost for infrastructure due to roads width. The author highlighted that the workplaces outside of residential areas aon the outskirt of cities. The developed model which provided support for energy and resource effieciency in settlement devleeopment and development of automated spatial simulation for settlement systems. With effect of different factors. 
                              Later the web application was shown for with its technical perspective. Web application for intented for devision making authorities (municipalities) and their planaeers. ArcGIS Javascript api, JQuery and bootstrap was used for building web application. 
                              Scenarios were made for housing potential. Calculated housing supply. In the end, reports were made in a dashboard. The technical part about web based simulation was particularly interesting as a different approach of carrying out simulations and simultaneous access to many people. This has potential to create new Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for urban development.
